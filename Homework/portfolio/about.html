            The agency was created by a young Congolese model Vedasta Masangu. Born in 1996, after spending her entire childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Vedasta remains imbued by the African culture. Her biggest dream was to become a supermodel like the British model Naomi Campbell. Unfortunately there were no modeling agency in Congo. Vedasta then decided to create her own modeling agency in the Democratic Republic of Congo to expand the career of many local models to a global status. She is currently attending the University of Miami where she studies advertising. The agencyâ€™s offices will be located in two cities: Kinshasa and Miami.
